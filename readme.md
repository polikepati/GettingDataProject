This project consists of run_analysis.R which downloads the file from internet and achieves the following goals. The tidy data is stored in TidyData.txt:
```{r}
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
